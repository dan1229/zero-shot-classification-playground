Some files included in this repository:
- `basic.py` - The most basic example of using the zero-shot classification pipeline. Hardcoded image and labels.
- `main.py` - A more advanced example of using the zero-shot classification pipeline. Allows for user input of image and labels as well as methods for label handling.
- `test.py` - A simple test script to test different label method performance on the zero-shot classification pipeline.
